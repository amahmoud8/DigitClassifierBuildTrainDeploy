# DigitClassifierBuildTrainDeploy
In this project, we implement, train and evaluate an MNIST classifier. 
This document presents instructions on how to train and evaluate the model. 
Moreover, a brief description on how to deploy the model within an inference server is presented. 
We also provide a script that can be used to send requests to the inference server and classify a single image or a directory of images. The script returns the most probable class and optionally the probabilities associated with all classes with respect to the input image. We also include an appendix section detailing the structure of the submitted files.
